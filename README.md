GUItopia features a live data collection and visualization system, demonstrating the collective impact GUI and its volunteers are achieving.

## About GUItopia
Introducing GUItopia, our innovative web application designed to revolutionize volunteer engagement and environmental impact tracking. At the heart of GUItopia is a dynamic volunteer portal where users can collect in-game items like water and seeds to plant trees, which can later be harvested for apples. These apples serve as currency for real-life rewards, providing tangible incentives for users to actively participate in environmental initiatives.

Our platform offers robust flexibility, allowing for easy updates and changes to the game to prevent user boredom. Through completing missions and declaring acts of environmentalism, users earn in-game currency. They can validate their actions by uploading picture proof via GUItopia, facilitating accurate measurement of volunteering impact. This data is then analyzed and presented through figures and charts on our webpage, providing valuable insights into community contributions.

To further engage users, GUItopia employs a nudge-based approach, featuring a leaderboard and game notifications. These subtle prompts remind users to stay active within the game, effectively encouraging sustained participation. By seamlessly integrating gaming elements with real-world environmental actions, GUItopia not only retains volunteers but also embodies the ethos of lifelong learning and sustainability.

## Features

- **Real-time data visualisation:** Charts and graphs that display the collective contributions of volunteers.
- **Gamification:** Gamified elements that encourage volunteers to increase their impact and track their progress against others.
- **Effective data collection:** Feedback form to measure the changes in volunteer habits.


## Philosphy
Our inspiration stems from a profound belief in the power of community-driven action and the transformative potential of gamification. Recognizing the challenge of accurately tracking and measuring the impact of volunteering efforts, we set out to create a solution that not only addresses this need but also fosters a deeper connection to environmental stewardship. Drawing inspiration from the ethos of Ground-Up Initiative (GUI), we envisioned a game that seamlessly integrates the joy of gaming with the fulfillment of making a tangible difference in the world.

Our solution is more than just a platform for reporting actions; it's a dynamic ecosystem that incentivizes and empowers volunteers to actively engage in environmentalism. By gamifying tasks such as recycling, tree planting, and composting, we aim to inspire a sense of ownership and responsibility towards sustainable practices. The incorporation of a nudge-based approach ensures sustained engagement, while the simulation of real-life activities adds authenticity and meaning to the experience.

At its core, our solution embodies the spirit of innovation, resilience, and grounded leadership championed by GUI. By harnessing the power of gaming, we seek to create a community-driven movement where every action, no matter how small, contributes to a larger collective impact. Through this approach, we hope to not only revolutionize how we measure volunteer impact but also cultivate a deeper sense of connection and purpose within the community.

## Technology used
- GUItopia was built using simple technologies like HTML, Javascript and Tailwind CSS to simplify game design and allow large flexibility for updates without heavy technical knowledge. In-game processes are dedicated largely to client-side, allowing the server to bear less load per active user. As a result, we foresee GUItopia to be highly scalable with little operational costs to run server capabilities.
- Frontend website is programmed with React and deployed via Vercel.
- Stylised with Atomise UI
